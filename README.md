# Penn-Collab-Project-1-Profile-Tracker
## Description
As a developer I want to input profiles and criteria, then input data into each profile under said criteria(s); and track the frequency and development of each criteria, then plot the information to visually display trends for each profile. In addition, I want to log historic information and filter it based-upon the given week of the year, i.e. Jan. 1st to 7th is week 1; I also want to provide additional theory resources that will assist the user for becoming more productive.

## CSS Framework / APIs (Third-party)
[Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/) - The modern CSS framework that just works..\
this was used to help style everything that we created.\

[Pixela API](https://pixe.la/) - API to record and track your habits or effort.\
this was used to create our graph for the second page of our site.\
\
[Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) - API to work with reddit content.\
this was used to link to the top three threads in the [r/productivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/) subreddit for the last page of our site.\
