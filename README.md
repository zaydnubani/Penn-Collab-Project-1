# Penn-Collab-Project-1-Profile-Tracker
## Description
This application tracks a profile (user, worker, etc.) and logs their criteria into a bar graph and monetizes their work. Uses APIs to visualize data and help productivity.

## CSS Framework / APIs (Third-party)
[Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/) - The modern CSS framework that just works..\
this was used to help style everything that we created.\
\
[Pixela API](https://pixe.la/) - API to record and track your habits or effort.\
this was used to create our graph for the second page of our site.\
\
[Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) - API to work with reddit content.\
this was used to link to the top three threads in the [r/productivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/) subreddit for the last page of our site.\

## Acceptance Criteria
```
AS A DEVELOPER, I want a program that can log past and current activities of a worker.
I WANT the current time and date to be pictured on the screen.
WHEN I input a name into the profile section.
THEN I will view the worker’s current or past progress.
WHEN I click the buttons in the navbar.
THEN the application is populated with information.
I WANT a way to send data to an API which is then implemented in a visual way.
I WANT the graph to plot a profile’s work and frequency.
I WANT a page that provides productivity resources.
```
